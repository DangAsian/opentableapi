1) I spent just short of 1.5 hours writing this code. I didn't quite understand the user story "which restaurants are currently available".
   I would get more insight on this, and improve it accordingly. I would also work more on testing and CSS (WCAG 2.0 AA accessibillity).
   Additionally, I would also fix some edge cases, and also build a function to change pages.

2) redux

3) Never had to do this, but interested to know the answer.

4) The API I used wasn't the one within the initial link (first link). The open table public API has no affiliation with OpenTable inc.
   https://opentable.herokuapp.com/

   I wouldn't necessarly make additionaly improvements. If I could make a change, maybe adding the opening and closing times of each restaurant.
